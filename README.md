# Getting and clearing data course project

In this project we have analyzed data that come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. The data has been collected from 30 subjects. Each subject is described by 561 variables.

This repository contains 3 main files:

1. tidy data set (tidydata.txt)
2. run_analysis.R (code written in R language that will help you to repeat the analysis)
3. codebook.md. In the codebook we have thoroughly described the dataset, variables and analysis plan

These 3 files will help you to understand and repeat the analysis on your computrer.

Cheers,
Michał Buczyński
